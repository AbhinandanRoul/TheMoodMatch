# TheMoodMatch
Mood Match is a place to find someone with your current mood. Many a times we feel lonely, and in this pandemic we are all away from each other. This app can help you to find someone whose mood matches your current mood. What you need to do is to fill in your emotion levels such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust and surprise on scale of 1 to 10. The algorithm finds your mood index based on your emotional levels. Then it finds someone with a similar mood to be your friend.
